       Hello everyone, this is my 3rd year at Chaffey College I graduation with a degree in computer information systems last spring. I wanted to do some more transfer classes and finished my second degree in cyber security by next spring. It was pretty cool to have my wife graduation at the same time I did at chaffey and she gets to do again after this semster!
